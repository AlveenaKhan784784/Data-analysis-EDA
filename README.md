# Data Analysis Project: Customer Personality Analysis

## Project Overview
The primary objectives include handling missing values, addressing outliers, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in the data.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Customer Personality Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)
## Data Understanding
- Perform initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, including shape, data types, and summary statistics.

## Handling Missing Values
- Identify missing values in the 'Income' column and handle them using the median. This approach helps to maintain the overall data distribution while addressing the issue of missing data.

## Handling Outliers
- Detect and handle outliers in the dataset using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Capping outliers ensures that they do not disproportionately affect statistical analyses and model performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct EDA to visualize and understand relationships between features. Key analyses include:
- **Correlation Matrix**: Analyzing the correlation between numerical features using a heatmap to identify strong relationships with the target variable.
